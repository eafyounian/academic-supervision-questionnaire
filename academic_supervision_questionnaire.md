# Academic supervision questionnaire  

Hello,  

It is great and exciting that we are going to work together on this project as a supervisor and a supervisee. This is going to be a journey that both of us will learn from one another and collaborate together to finalize this project as best as we can and on time. But before we start, I would like you to read the following questions/tasks, reflect upon them, and answer them as best and sincerely as you can. You have a few days to return the answers, so please take your time! In a few days after the answers have been returned, we will have a one-to-one meeting and we can go through the answers. This would help us to start learning about each other – especially about our views about teaching and learning and also about the supervision process right from the beginning.
