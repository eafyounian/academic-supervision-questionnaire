This repository contains a [questionnaire](academic_supervision_questionnaire.md) that the supervisor shares with the student (supervisee) who is starting to work on her/his master’s or PhD thesis work.  

This repository contains a questionnaire ([markdown](academic_supervision_questionnaire.md), [PDF](academic_supervision_questionnaire.pdf)) that the supervisor shares with the student (supervisee) who is starting to work on her/his master’s or PhD thesis work.

The supervisee is then given enough time (few days to a week) with the questionnaire to reflect on her/his answers and conceptions and to externalize them by writing them down.  

After returning the answers, the supervisor has few days to go through the supervisee’s answers.  

In a meeting, then, both the supervisor and the supervisee go through the answers together and compare and contrast the differences in their conceptions and try to find a middle ground that maximizes the benefits of supervision.  

This questionnaire started as an experiment implemented for the course **Academic Supervision and Guidance** [[course description here]](https://www.tuni.fi/studentsguide/curriculum/course-units/uta-ykoodi-45708?year=2019).  

The questions in the questionnaire are based on concepts from peer-reviewed scientific articles. Below you can find the list of references.
